I have always been fascinated by all things *meta* so I got myself into building one!

This projects aims to mimick an iPhone 13, from the basic interfaces of iOS to any app you can imagine.

The project was built to be extensible, hence it's pretty easy to code an "app" and then plug it into the phone.

Scalability was also thought of since every route (therefore app) is lazy loaded.

I will be adding a tutorial in the future on how to code a phone app but in the meantime you can take a look at those existing in `src/app/phoneApps`.

Check out the demo [here](https://iphone-js.web.app/).
